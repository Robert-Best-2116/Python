Dictionary
    a Dictionary is a changeable sequence type that can store any number of python objects, including other sequence types lists and the like. Dictionarys go by a couple other names, such as associative array, or hash table, a hash table is the most generic term. 

    Dictionary Characteristics
        its an unordered collectoin of objects
        values are accessed usuing a key, usually a string
        dictonarys can grow or shrink 
        their contents can be modififed,
        they can be nested inside of other Dictionarys 
        sequence operations like slice cant be used in dictonarys

    Keys Vs Indexes
        Instead of usuing indexes like a list would do dictonarys use Keys to track position, whats the diffrence we ask?
            keys are usually strings, indexes are always integers
            keys can be in anyyy order, they are not stored in order.  indexes are orered, least to greatest, (lists and tuples)
            Dictionarys only have keys, They dont have indexes

    Creating Dictionarys 
        Creating a dictonary is pretty much just like creating any other dequence, they use the same format, name = but they use {} instead of () or [] 

        #literal notation
        person = {"first": "Ada", "last": "Lovelace", "age": 42, "is_organ_donor": True}
        capitals = {} #create an empty dictionary

    Adding new key-value pairs
        ditionarys do not have an append feature, like lists which i love. you add new key-value pairs much like creating a new variabile

            dictionary_name["key"] = "value"

            whalla new addition the dictonary
