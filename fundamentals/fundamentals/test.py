#4Iterate Through a Dictionary with List Values
#Create a function printInfo(some_dict) that given a dictionary whose values are all lists, prints the name of each key along with the size of its list, and then prints the associated values within each key's list. For example:

#dojo = {
    #'locations': ['San Jose', 'Seattle', 'Dallas', 'Chicago', 'Tulsa', 'DC', 'Burbank'],
    #'instructors': ['Michael', 'Amy', 'Eduardo', 'Josh', 'Graham', 'Patrick', 'Minh', 'Devon']
#}
#printInfo(dojo)
# output:
#7 LOCATIONS
#San Jose Seattle Dallas Chicago Tulsa DC Burbank


#what do i need to do? i need to access the dictonary,then access its values which are all lists, test with print function
# once i can do that, i need to print the name of each of the keys, which is outside of the list, because its the key, and the length of the value, which is a list. 
# after that i need to print the values paired to that key.
